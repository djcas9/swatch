# ![alt text](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/mephux/swatch/master/app/styles/images/logo-small.png) Swatch

Swatch is a Mac OSX appliation for simple color manipulation. I wanted something simple and easy to use for HSLA color conversion and a tool to help me define color schemas while doing web design. This is a very simple application and likely wont be useful to anyone other than me -- I was interested in building a node-webkit application using requirejs and backbone.
